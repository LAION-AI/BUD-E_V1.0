BUD-E (Buddy) is an open-source voice assistant framework that facilitates seamless interaction with AI models and APIs, enabling the creation and integration of diverse skills for educational and research applications.


BUD-E_V1.0 has a client-server-architecture that allows users to communicate with the assistant on edge devices, while the main computation is conducted on a server (that could be either in the cloud or on the same device, if it has a strong GPU).
